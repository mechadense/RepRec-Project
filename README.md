# RepRec-Project

Investigating a peculiar part of the design space of  
**productive self-replicating pick-and-place robots**  
by identifying, analyzing, designing, and testing (prototyping) the function and interplay of  
necessary sub-systems for a first initial instance of such a machine.

## Context

**Primary aim/focus here is prototyping for future [macroscale style machinery at the nanoscale](http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Macroscale_style_machinery_at_the_nanoscale).**  
* This is about **NON-compact self-replication** with pre-produced parts that are supplied  
from a lower assembly-level (where they will be mass pre-produced via [piezochemical mechanosynthesis](http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Piezochemical_mechanosynthesis)).  
* This is not to be associated with the outdated concept of molecular assemblers!  
(Molecular assemblers were about direct atom-by-atom self-replication – ultra-compact self-replication – difficult, inefficient, undesirable).  

Results of this work may also be usable in other contexts.  
Note that some design decisions that originate from the *primary aim/focus* of  
gemstone based nanomachinery here might not seem sensible in these other contexts.  

**Two main other contexts coming to mind are:**
* The automated space industry (including space mining) – think recomposable trussworks and [von Neumann probes (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft)
* The DIY manufacturing field – think RepRap 3D printers augmented with RepRec robots reducing the need for manual assembly  
DIY workshop usage seems rather questionable in feasibility, given size, slowness, and cost. We'll see.

If nothing else results may at least by pretty.  
Elaborate kinetic sculptures, oddly satisfying to watch.  
Don't expect masterpieses like [Martins Marble Machine X series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLLYkE3G1HED6rW-bkliHbMroHYFf4ukv) though.  
An eventual complete prototype is supposed to become a productive self-replicator, so it should become able to assemble just about anything.  
Including marble-machines. I will most certainly not go that route though.
